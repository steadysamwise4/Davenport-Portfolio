                    <p>I am not currently employed in web development. I am attending the coding bootcamp for full stack development, provided by the University of Kansas.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Though the skills I am learning are new to me, I am finding that I enjoy learning and working with these technologies(html and css so far). I am very meticulous in my work, and continually strive for excellence in all of my endeavors</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>During my recent employment in manufacturing, I have established a reputation for having a terrific work ethic and a positive attitude. Honesty and integrety are very important to me. I have repeatedly shown a willingness and ability to take on new challenges and learn new skills. This has helped to set the tone in each of the various departments I have worked in.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My current web-development program will last 6 months, and end in March of 2022. I will be seeking employment in the field of web-development as I get closer to that date, and as I acquire more knowledge and skills. Reach out at samueldavenport@att.net to connect!</p>
